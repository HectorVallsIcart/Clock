Clock Function – Python Project

<<Description>>
This project contains a simple Python function that receives a time string in the format "HH:MM:SS" and returns a dictionary with:
the hour, minute, and second as integers a message depending on the time of day a descriptive text showing the time functionality

The clock(num) function:
-Splits the input string into hours, minutes, and seconds
-Converts each part into an integer
-Determines a message based on the hour:
1–7 → It's still time to sleep
8–13 → Good morning
14–20 → Good afternoon
21–24 / 0 → Good night
-Returns a dictionary containing all the processed information

<<Code Example:>>
def clock(num):
    # Split the input string "HH:MM:SS"
    hour_text, minute_text, second_text = num.split(":")

    # Convert each part to integer
    hour = int(hour_text)
    minute = int(minute_text)
    second = int(second_text)

    # Determine message based on time range
    if 1 <= hour < 8:
        sms = "It's still time to sleep"
    elif 8 <= hour < 14:
        sms = "Good morning"
    elif 14 <= hour < 21:
        sms = "Good afternoon"
    else:
        sms = "Good night"

    return {
        "hour": hour,
        "minute": minute,
        "second": second,
        "sms": sms,
        "text": f"It is {hour}:{minute}:{second}"
    }


<<Usage Example:>>
------------>         print(clock("09:30:15"))

It will retur as an Output:

{
    'hour': 9,
    'minute': 30,
    'second': 15,
    'sms': 'Good morning',
    'text': 'It is 9:30:15'
}

<<Project Purpose>>
This small project is useful for practicing:
-string manipulation
-type conversion
-conditional logic
-returning structured data with dictionaries
